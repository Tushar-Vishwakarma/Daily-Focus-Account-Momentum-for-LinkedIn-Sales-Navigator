# Daily-Focus-Account-Momentum-for-LinkedIn-Sales-Navigator

**Daily Focus** is a product concept and UI prototype that reimagines how sellers prioritize accounts inside **LinkedIn Sales Navigator**.

Sales Navigator excels at lead discovery, but sellers still struggle with a critical daily question:
**“Which accounts should I focus on today?”**

This project addresses that gap by shifting Sales Navigator from **static lead lists** to a **dynamic, momentum-driven prioritization model**.

## 💡 What This Project Demonstrates

* A **system-level product solution** to a real B2B sales problem
* How event-based signals (hiring, engagement, role changes) can drive daily focus
* A UI that fits naturally within **existing Sales Navigator workflows**
* PM thinking across **problem framing, solution design, and success metrics**

## 🧠 Core Idea

Instead of showing sellers thousands of possible leads, **Daily Focus surfaces 5–7 priority accounts each day**, ranked by recent changes in buying momentum and relevance.

The goal is not more data — it’s **better decisions with limited time**.


## 🧩 Key Concepts

* **Account Momentum**: Prioritization based on change, not static attributes
* **Time-Weighted Relevance**: Account priority rises and decays automatically
* **Decision-First UI**: Optimized for daily execution, not exploration
* **Low Cognitive Load**: No extra manual tagging or maintenance


## 📐 What’s Included

* High-fidelity UI mockups inspired by LinkedIn Sales Navigator
* Interaction flows for Daily Focus and account prioritization
* Product rationale, assumptions, and success metrics

> Note: This is a **product concept and prototype**, not an official LinkedIn feature.


## 🎯 Who This Is For

* Product Managers evaluating prioritization & decision-support systems
* Hiring managers reviewing product thinking depth
* Designers interested in enterprise B2B UX
* Anyone exploring how to build **habit-forming professional tools**
